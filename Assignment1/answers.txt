Algo is in main.py

1. Why is the overall distribution of points in the plot the way it is?

    Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm. It is greedy because
    it always chooses the cheapest path to the next node. 
    This means that as each path is getting more expensive, the algorithm will expand nodes that were originally 
    not part of the cheapest path. 

    BIBS however is essentially 2 Dijkstra's going from start and goal. 
    Although the difference in expanded nodes between the two algo is not that big,
    the fact that we are skipping over expanding further nodes when the 2 searches meet up
    saves the algorithm a few iteration since when the search of backward and forward meets,
    it is guaranteed that the path it intersects with is the cheapest of the paths in their perspective direction.


2.  why some of the points are clearly below the main diagonal?

    below the diagonal means that BIBS expanded more nodes than Dijkstra's. 
    This can occur when the start and goal state is relatively close, with no obstacles. 
    Since BIBS is essentially 2 Dijkstra's going from start and goal, it will expand more than if just one Dijkstra
    was used.

3. Why some of the points are clearly above the main diagonal?

    above the diagonal means that BIBS expanded less nodes than Dijkstra's. 
    This can occur when the start and goal state is relatively far, with deadends and obstacles. 
    Dijkstras algorithm will expand from start where if an obstacle or deadend is encountered, 
    will have to backtrack and expand more node until goal is found

    BIBS will expand from both ends, where if a dead end or obstacle is met, will backtrack but only expand
    until the 2 directions intersect.
